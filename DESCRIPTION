Description: Offers a gene-based meta-analysis test with filtering to detect gene-environment interactions (GxE) with association data, proposed by Wang et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22115>. It first conducts a meta-filtering test to filter out unpromising SNPs by combining all samples in the consortia data. It then runs a test of omnibus-filtering-based GxE meta-analysis (ofGEM) that combines the strengths of the fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis with meta-filtering. It can also analyze data from multiple ethnic groups.
